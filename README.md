I have automated the calculation of a formula by coding this is calculator which calculates a specific formula known as the liquidity ratio.
This is done by inputing the numbers you have been given from a text book or question paper and by pressing enter it will have given you the answer.
Also i have used function so that the process can be repeated as many times as the user wants.
